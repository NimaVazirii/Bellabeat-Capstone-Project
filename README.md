### Introduction

Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of beautifully-designed health-focused smart products for women since 2013. Inspiring and empowering women with knowledge about their own health and habits, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for females.

The Co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen is confident that an analysis of non-Bellabeat consumer data (ie.FitBit fitness tracker usage data) would reveal more opportunities for growth. Our Marketing Analytics Team have been asked to analyze smart device data to gain insight into how consumers are using their smart devices. The insights that will be discovered will then help guide marketing strategy for the company.
